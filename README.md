This package contains a set of functions to download, transform, and plot data from NOAA ISD weather stations. 

For example, you may want to:
- Find the k-nearest stations to a city, or any other location that can be found via google maps
- Plot the stations and reference point for any location
- Download all k-nearest station data to a given location for a range of years
- Select a station with the best data to a given location and interpolate missing observations
